## How to use

- Make sure you have the latest .NET Desktop Runtime installed. You can download it [here through the official microsoft website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-8.0.6-windows-x64-installer)
- Download the latest release from the [releases](https://github.com/Myuuiii/DAWPresence/releases/) tab.
- Run the executable to create initial configuration files. The software will continue to run in the background.
- Close the software by running the executable again. You can change the config to your liking.
- Upon running the software, if it has detected a DAW that is currently supported, your Discord presence should be updated automatically.

### Running as a Background Service & Using the Tray Icon

DAWPresence runs as a background app and provides a tray icon for easy access and management.

#### How to Install and Run

1. **Download & Extract:** Download the latest release and extract it to a folder of your choice.
2. **Run the App:** Double-click the `DAWPresenceBackgroundApp.exe` file. The app will start in the background and show a tray icon in your Windows system tray (bottom-right corner).
3. **Tray Icon Features:**
	- **Right-click the tray icon** to access options such as exit, reload config, or open the config folder.
	- **Left-click** may show status or bring up a menu (depending on version).
4. **Auto-Start (Optional):** To have DAWPresence start automatically with Windows:
	- **Right-click the tray icon** and check the `Open on Startup` option in the menu. This will automatically configure DAWPresence to launch with Windows using the built-in method.
5. **Stopping the App:**
	- Right-click the tray icon and select `Exit`, or run the executable again to close it.

### Adding a new DAW

If you want to add a new DAW or want a maintainer to, you can do so by following the steps below:

### DIY:

- Create a new branch in the format `{username}/{DAWname}-support` 
- Create a new class in the `DAWPresenceBackgroundApp/DAWs` folder that inherits from `Daw`
- Provide required values, such as the process name, window title, and the DAW name
- Push the branch to the repository
- Create a pull request to the main branch
- A maintainer will review the pull request and provide feedback
- Once the pull request is approved, it will be merged into the main branch

*Don't worry about the ApplicationId, one of the maintainers will provide those for you*

### Requesting a new DAW

- Create a new issue with the `DAW REQUEST` label
- Provide the name of the DAW and any additional information that might be useful (such as window title when no project is loaded, and when a project is loaded)
- A maintainer will create a new branch and add the DAW to the project for you
- You can then test the new DAW support and provide feedback
- Once the DAW is working as expected, the branch will be merged into the main branch

## Custom Image Key

Some people might want a custom image on the rich presence. To bump the project a bit, I am making this exclusive to people that have starred this repository. For those that have, please contact `myuuiii` on Discord for more information. An example is shown below
